# Customers-segmentation

In this project, I aimed to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics using clustering techniques. I employed the KMeans algorithm to divide the customer base into distinct groups and performed a detailed analysis of each segment to gain deeper insights into their preferences and responses to marketing campaigns.

The key steps of the project included:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and standardized numerical features to prepare the data for clustering.

Clustering: Using KMeans, I segmented customers into three clusters. I determined the optimal number of clusters through the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, both of which indicated that a 3-cluster solution was the most appropriate.

Cluster Profiling: I analyzed each cluster in terms of income, spending on luxury products, and purchasing behavior. The results revealed three distinct segments:

Cluster 1: High-income, luxury-oriented customers, showing strong engagement with marketing campaigns.

Cluster 0: Moderate-income customers, responsive to promotions and making frequent purchases both online and in-store.

Cluster 2: Price-sensitive, low-income customers, with lower engagement in marketing efforts and fewer purchases overall.

Campaign Analysis: I further examined the effectiveness of past marketing campaigns and found that Cluster 1 was the most responsive, while Cluster 2 showed minimal interaction with marketing efforts.

Visualization: I used PCA and t-SNE to visualize the clusters, confirming that they were well-separated and meaningfully distinct in the feature space.

Key Results:

The three identified clusters displayed significant differences in income levels, purchasing preferences, and responsiveness to marketing.

Cluster 1, consisting of high-income customers, represents the most valuable segment for future marketing efforts, particularly for luxury product promotions.

Cluster 0 shows potential for regular promotions, as these customers are active shoppers both online and in-store.

Cluster 2 should be targeted with budget-friendly offers, though it may require less investment in aggressive marketing.

This segmentation provides actionable insights for more targeted marketing strategies, ensuring that each group receives tailored campaigns suited to their preferences and purchasing power.
